## Frontend

We would love to have help with Krok especially on the frontend side. None of us ( currently ) know frontend development too well.
We do plan on having a frontend for Krok alongside the CLI([krokctl](https://github.com/krok-o/krokctl)).

## Commands

Commands are never enough. Krok lives for the command it can execute on each webhook action. Without the commands Krok is almost useless.
Writing commands extends the universe of Krok and makes Krok itself more useful.
